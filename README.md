when it comes to the entire application the application reads the application and does all the commands for artist, movie, concert. Issues that i have encountered are list in the what is not complete section

getting the read text file to get the answer from the readme.txt file to come back to the list of commands 

Getting inquirer to work as expected and make the readme.txt working

after containerizing the variable for spotify it cannot find the spotify keys anymore so need to fix that piece

anothe issue is with connecting the right fields for the liri.js. Having difficulty with finding the right fields for movie and bands
